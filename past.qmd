### LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings (BpSs)

<br>

> *BpS models represent the vegetation system that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to Euro-American settlement. These models are based on a combination of the current environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime.* [Read more](https://landfire.gov/bps.php){target="blank"}.

Check out this 3-minute tutorial for a quick refresher on the [basics of Biophysical Settings Models](https://youtu.be/xjaWJCe7udQ){target="blank"}.

Use this page as a starting point to explore the most prevalent BpSs for your analysis area. In addition to the charts and maps, the historical disturbance data can be directly accessed using this site.

## Associated Biophysical Settings descriptions

Below you will find a list of Biophysical Settings (BpS) in the map and chart  linked to their descriptions.  Note:

* There may be multiple BpS names listed.  If so, this is because your landscape spans multiple LANDFIRE Map Zones and has multiple 'variants' for those BPSs.  
* The names below are followed by a number in parentheses.  The first 5-digit number is the BPS Code.  The following numbers reprent the Map Zones.  For example, "13020_65_66" is ‘Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods forest’ BpS (13020) in Map Zones 65 and 66.
* The map below will help orient you to the Map Zones for your landscape.
