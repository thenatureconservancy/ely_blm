To present these broad ecosystem trends more effectively, we combined classifications of Existing Vegetation Types (EVT) into broader categories.\nSecond, we compare amounts of succession classes (past and present) for the most prevalent ecosystems.\n\n\n\nIn the chart below the vertical bands represent amounts of the broad ecosystem types, with the past amounts on the left and current amounts on the right. Hovering over the verticle bands will illuminate the amounts in acres. The ‘traces’ or grey bands show transitions from past to current. For example, some areas that may have been mapped as conifer in the Biophysical Settings data might currently be mapped as conifer in the Existing Vegetation Type data set, and some of those areas formerly mapped as conifer might be mapped as having been converted to a developed land use. Hovering over the traces will illuminate amounts in acres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing LANDFIRE’s Biophysical Settings spatial data to essentially map ‘ecosystem habitats’ and state-and-transition models to estimate the expected historical amounts of their succession classes we can estimate reference conditions under natural disturbance regimes. We can then quantify current succession class amounts with LANDFIRE’s succession class data. Below are succession class charts that allow for an exploration of which classes are over or under represented.\nIn this landscape we observed:\n\nThe Great Basin Xeric Mixed Sagebrush Shrubland had the largest divergence between reference and current conditions with a substantial under representation of class C, which is the “Late - seral community with a mixture of herbaceous and shrub vegetation; 10-25% sagebrush canopy cover present . Dispersed conifer seedlings and saplings established at &lt;6% cover.” Class B, “Mid-seral community with a mixture of herbaceous and shrub vegetation; 6- 25 % sagebrush (sagebrush/brush) canopy cover present” is over represented.\nCurrently the Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland-Upland system is largely missing classes A and B, which represent the Early post-disturbance grass and forb state, and the mid-open shrub state respectively.\nIn the Inter-Mountain Basins Mixed Salt Desert Scrub system there is an under representation of class B, which is a mid-open class dominated by shadscale, and an over representation of class C, which is a mid-open class dominated by budsage."
